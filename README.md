# Workflow
A set of dotfiles and utilities used to configure desktop environments and automate workflows on Linux machines running i3wm with X window systems.

## To Install Configs
* clone repository 
* `cd /path/to/directory/.workflow`
* `$ make build` to merge local and shared configs into .build directory
    * examine the files in .build/. This set of files will be copied into ~/
        * note: if files exist in ~/ (or subdirectories like ~/.config/...), whose filenames
            match those in .build, and whose paths (relative to ~) match those in .build (relative
            to .build), they will be completely overwritten. No other files will be affected. Be
            sure to examine the files in .build before installing 
* `$ make install` to copy configs from .build to home directory

## Structure
* Makefile
* _admin/
    * installation scripts called by Makefile
* _lib/
    * inactive config files for reference, notes
* configs/
    * local/
        * configurations specific to local machine, not tracked by Git.
        * if a file exists in both local/ and shared/, the local file will
            be concatenated to the shared file during build process
    * shared/
        * configurations which can be used by any Linux machine with required
            dependencies installed. 
        * note: some configs are incomplete, and will require a partial config
            with the same filename under local/ to work properly when installed
* utils/
    * local/
        * utility scripts specific to local machine, not tracked by Git
    * shared/
        * utility scripts which can be used on any Linux machine
* .build/
    * staging for compiled config files, after build, install script copies from this directory to ~/
* .cache/
    * temp files used by utils scripts
* .logs/
    * logs generated by utils scripts for testing/debugging

## Dependencies
* i3-gaps    (window manager)
* i3-blocks  (utility bar)
* compton    (X Window compositor)
* ranger     (terminal file manager)
* termite    (terminal emulator)
* rofi 	     (application launcher, window switcher)
* Python 3.x
* Node.js
* npm

## TODO
* integrate crontab
* update READMEs in subdirectories
* improve build process
* investigate merge conflicts with grive
